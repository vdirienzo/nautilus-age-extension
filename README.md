## 📖 Usage

### Encrypt a file

1. Open Nautilus (GNOME Files)
2. Navigate to your file
3. **Right-click** → **"Encrypt with age"**
4. A secure 24-word passphrase is generated and copied to clipboard
5. **Save the passphrase** in a password manager
6. Optionally check **"Delete original after encryption"**
7. Click **Encrypt**
8. ✅ Creates `file.ext.age`

### Encrypt multiple files

1. **Select multiple files** (Ctrl + Click)
2. **Right-click** → **"Encrypt N files with age"**
3. Save the generated passphrase
4. All files are encrypted with the same passphrase

### Encrypt a complete folder

1. **Right-click on a folder** → **"Encrypt folder with age"**
2. Save the generated passphrase
3. Creates `folder.tar.gz.age` (compressed and encrypted)
4. Optionally, accept deleting the original folder

### Decrypt files

1. **Right-click on .age file** → **"Decrypt with age"**
2. Enter your passphrase
3. Original file is recovered
4. If it's a folder (`.tar.gz`), it's automatically extracted

### 🎲 Secure Passphrase (Automatic)

When encrypting files or folders, a **secure passphrase is automatically generated** - no manual passwords allowed for maximum security:

1. Right-click and select **"Encrypt with age"**
2. A secure 24-word passphrase is generated automatically
3. The passphrase is **automatically copied to clipboard**
4. **SAVE IT NOW** in a password manager before clicking Encrypt

**Security features:**
- **Cryptographically secure**: Uses Python `secrets` module (CSPRNG)
- **24 words**: ~215 bits of entropy - impossible to brute-force
- **No weak passwords**: Manual entry disabled - can't use "123456"
- **One-click flow**: No need to type or confirm anything

**The passphrase dialog shows:**
```
📋 Passphrase copied to clipboard!

tiger-ocean-mountain-castle-brave-silent-...

⚠️ Save this passphrase now!

[Cancel]  [🔒 Encrypt (keep original)]  [🔒🗑️ Encrypt & Delete original]
```

### 🧹 Automatic Metadata Cleaning

When `mat2` is installed, metadata is **automatically cleaned** before encryption:

- **No prompts needed** - cleaning happens silently in the background
- **Original files preserved** - metadata is cleaned from temporary copies only
- **Encrypted output** - the `.age` file contains metadata-free content
- **Your originals are safe** - they keep all their metadata untouched

**What gets cleaned:**
- **Photos**: EXIF data (GPS location, camera model, timestamps)
- **Documents**: Author name, company, creation/modification dates
- **PDFs**: Metadata, comments, revision history
- **Audio**: ID3 tags, artist, album information
- **Video**: Creation dates, camera info, GPS

**Supported formats** (via mat2):
- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF
- Documents: DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, ODS, ODP
- PDFs: PDF files
- Audio: MP3, FLAC, OGG
- Video: MP4, AVI, MKV
- Archives: ZIP, TAR

**Requirements:**
- `mat2` is installed automatically by the installer
- Metadata cleaning is always available

**Why clean metadata?**
- Photos can reveal your location (GPS), camera, and when they were taken
- Documents often contain your name, company, and edit history
- Cleaning metadata protects your privacy when sharing encrypted files

### 🔐 Optional: HSM Support (SafeNet eToken)

For high-security environments, you can generate passphrases using a hardware security module's True Random Number Generator (TRNG).

**Requirements:**
- SafeNet eToken with libeToken.so driver
- opensc package (`sudo apt install opensc`)

**Installation with HSM support:**
```bash
./install.sh --with-pkcs11
```

**Usage:**

When a SafeNet token is detected, an additional menu option appears:
- **🔐 Encrypt with HSM** - Uses hardware TRNG for passphrase generation

The HSM option:
1. Detects if libeToken.so is installed (auto-detection)
2. Verifies the token is physically connected
3. Prompts for your token PIN
4. Generates 256 bytes (2048 bits) of true hardware random
5. Encodes as Base64 passphrase (~342 characters)

**Benefits of HSM encryption:**
- **True hardware randomness** - Not software PRNG, actual quantum-level entropy
- **Isolated generation** - Entropy cannot be compromised by userspace malware
- **Compliance ready** - FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ certified hardware
- **Defense in depth** - Even if your system is compromised, the TRNG is independent

**Security model:**
| Aspect | Software (secrets) | Hardware (HSM) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Entropy source | /dev/urandom (CSPRNG) | Physical TRNG |
| Compromisable by malware | Theoretically possible | No |
| Requires hardware | No | Yes |
| FIPS 140-2 | No | Level 3+ |
| Speed | Instant | ~500ms |

**Note:** For most users, the software-generated passphrase (24 words, ~215 bits) is already more than sufficient. HSM support is for high-security environments with specific compliance requirements or threat models that include sophisticated state-level attackers.

**Configuring HSM passphrase length:**

You can customize the HSM passphrase length by editing `nautilus-age-extension.py`:

```python
# Line ~60 - Default is 256 bytes (2048 bits)
PKCS11_RANDOM_BYTES = 256  # 2048 bits of entropy (~342 chars Base64)
```

| Value | Bits | Base64 Length | Security Level |
|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| `128` | 1024 bits | ~171 chars | High (sufficient for most use cases) |
| `256` | 2048 bits | ~342 chars | Very High (default) |
| `512` | 4096 bits | ~683 chars | Extreme (overkill for most scenarios) |

**When to change:**
- **Reduce to 128**: If you need shorter passphrases for manual entry or limited storage
- **Keep at 256**: Recommended default - excellent security without excessive length
- **Increase to 512**: Only for extreme paranoia or specific compliance requirements

> **Security note:** Even 128 bytes (1024 bits) from a hardware TRNG is astronomically secure. The default of 256 bytes provides a massive security margin.

## 🎯 Use Case Examples

### Case 1: Confidential documents

```
secret-document.pdf
→ Encrypt with age
→ secret-document.pdf.age (encrypted)
→ Delete original ✓
```

### Case 2: Complete project backup

```
my-project/
  ├── code/
  ├── documentation/
  └── data/

→ Encrypt folder with age
→ my-project.tar.gz.age (everything compressed and encrypted)
```

### Case 3: Sharing encrypted files

```
1. Encrypt: photo.jpg → photo.jpg.age
2. Share photo.jpg.age via email/USB
3. Share password through another channel (Signal, phone call)
4. Recipient: Right-click → Decrypt with age
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Change number of shred passes

Edit `nautilus-age-extension.py`:

```python
# Line ~900 - Default is 3 passes (more than sufficient)
['shred', '-vfzu', '-n', '1', file_path]  # 1 pass (NIST SP 800-88 recommendation)
```

> **Security Note (2025):** The Gutmann method (35 passes) is obsolete. It was designed in 1996 for MFM/RLL drives. Peter Gutmann himself has stated it's excessive for modern hardware. NIST SP 800-88 recommends just 1 pass for modern HDDs. The default of 3 passes is already conservative.

### Disable secure deletion

Comment these lines in the `on_encrypt_files` method:

```python
# if delete_originals:
#     self.secure_delete(file_path)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear in Nautilus

```bash
# Verify python3-nautilus is installed
dpkg -l | grep python3-nautilus

# Verify extension is in the right place
ls -la ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/

# Restart Nautilus
nautilus -q
killall nautilus
nautilus &
```

### Error: "age is not installed"

```bash
# Install age
sudo apt install age

# Verify installation
age --version
```

### Dialogs don't appear

```bash
# Verify zenity
which zenity

# If not installed
sudo apt install zenity
```

### Notifications don't work

```bash
# Verify notify-send
which notify-send

# If not installed
sudo apt install libnotify-bin
```

### Permission error

```bash
# Grant execution permissions
chmod +x ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/nautilus-age-extension.py
```

## 🔐 Security and Best Practices

### Strong passwords

✅ **GOOD:**
- `correct-horse-battery-staple-2024-secure`
- `Tr0ub4dor&3-MySecretP@ssw0rd!`
- Minimum 20 characters
- Mix of words, numbers, symbols

❌ **BAD:**
- `password123`
- `qwerty`
- Your name
- Short passwords

### Sharing encrypted files

1. **NEVER** send the .age file and password through the same channel
2. .age file → Email/USB
3. Password → Signal/Phone call/SMS
4. For maximum security: share password in person

### File verification

The extension automatically verifies that .age files are valid before attempting to decrypt them.

### Secure deletion

- **Default:** `shred` overwrites the file 3 times (conservative, more than needed)
- **NIST SP 800-88:** Recommends just 1 pass for modern HDDs
- **Gutmann method (35 passes):** Obsolete since ~2000, designed for ancient MFM/RLL drives

**Important limitations:**

| Storage Type | shred Effectiveness |
|--------------|---------------------|
| HDD (traditional) | ✅ Effective - 1-3 passes sufficient |
| SSD/NVMe | ❌ Ineffective - wear leveling bypasses overwrites |
| Encrypted files | ✅ Destroying the key is enough |

**Why shred doesn't work on SSDs:**
- Wear leveling redistributes writes across cells
- Over-provisioning hides sectors from the OS
- TRIM marks blocks for deletion asynchronously
- Flash Translation Layer prevents direct sector access

**For SSDs:** Use `blkdiscard --secure` or ATA Secure Erase for full drive wipes.

**Best practice:** For encrypted files, destroying the encryption key makes data unrecoverable regardless of storage type.
